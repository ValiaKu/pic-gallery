# A few notes about implementation of DJinni Front End Test assignment

## Styles

In this task Bootstrap (5) CSS framework is used with small injection of custom styling. In some places I override Bootstrap classes to align them with the design

## Scripts

Text truncating on the second row  is realized by Vanilla JS. It's integrated into 'infinite scroll ' feature


Switcher to Dark theme is small piece of simple JavaScript, which adds 'dark-theme' css class to body (Switcher is located instead of not denoted feature for Latest/Newest cards)

Boostrap 5 JS bundle is included to enable navigation toggling on small screens
